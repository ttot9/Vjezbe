		<p>The Royal Oak came along at a moment in the early 1970s when Audemars Piguet, like the entire Swiss watch industry, was facing an existential threat. The so-called ‘quartz crisis’ — the emergence of inexpensive quartz-powered movements — spelled disaster for the Swiss maisons, all of which specialised in costly mechanical dress watches. And in the world at large, lifestyles were changing. Customers were looking for a watch that they could wear all day at work, take out on the slopes, and then keep on for dinner — a practical piece of kit rather than a time-telling item of jewellery. What people wanted, did they but know it, was a sports watch. On the eve of the Swiss Watch Show in 1971, he asked Gérald Genta to design a new watch for the firm. It had to be stylish but democratic, made from steel not gold, innovative but attractive — oh, and the design had to be ready the next day. It is often said that Genta was inspired by the metal collar of a deep-sea diving helmet, or the portholes of a battle cruiser. The name is certainly nautical; it was borrowed from Britain’s Royal Navy, which over the course of 300 years has seen eight vessels called the Royal Oak  (fighting ships, like fine watches, go through many iterations).</p>
